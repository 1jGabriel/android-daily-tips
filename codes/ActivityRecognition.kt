 Activity Recognition gives our android device the ability to detect a number of our physical activities.

 // The Activity Recognition API is an interface that periodically wakes the device,
 // reads bursts of data from the deviceâ€™s sensors, and then analyzes this data using powerful machine learning models.

 The activities supported with the Transition API are:
    * IN_VEHICLE
    * ON_FOOT
    * RUNNING
    * WALKING
    * ON_BICYCLE
    * STILL

 // To use the Transition API requirement
 * Permission  --> <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.gms.permission.ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION"/>
 * API version -->  12.0.0 or higher
